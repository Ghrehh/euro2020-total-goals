Frontend to display goal data

Run `node getData.js` with a valid `FOOTBALL_DATA_ACCESS_TOKEN` in you
environment to populate the data needed to run the app locally.

This same data is pulled down automatically on GitHub during deploys to ensure
the site is built with the latest information. A build can be triggered manually
on GitHub to keep information up to date.
